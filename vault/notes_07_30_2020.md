Vault thoughts:

1. Process
  * install via repo
  * generate vault.hcl config from switches
    - unseal type: shamir, autounseal
    - storage backend: raft, file, consul
    - certificate: private key and certificate
    - cluster members: ips or hostnames
2. setup:
  * install via repo
  * generate vault hcl
  * check if cluster init
  * init cluster if not init
  * save root token and unseal keys or recovery keys
  * unseal cluster if not unsealed
  * check peers status
  * join peers to cluster
  * enable auth methods
  * configure auth methods
3. Example yaml:
```
---
- vault_install:
    #type can equal: repository, binary, container
    type: repository
    #version can equal: latest or verison number in format 1.5.0 / 1.5.0-2
    version: latest
- unseal_type:
    #type can be: shamir, transit, hsm, awskms, azurekms
    type: shamir
    #key number is numeric value of total unseal keys to create
    key_number: 5
    #key_threshold is the number of keys needed to perform unseal
    key_threshold 3
- storage_backend:
    #type can be: raft, consul, file
    type: raft
    #path is the file path to create the raft files in
    path: /vault/raft/
- certificate:
    #type can be: file, variable
    type: file
    #private key path: certificate private key contents path
    private_key_path: /vault/cert.key
    #certificate_path: certificate contents path
    certificate_path: /vault/cert.crt
- cluster_members:
    #host_list: list of ip addresses or hostnames for cluster members to install vault on and join to cluster
    host_list: 
      - 10.x.x.10
      - 10.x.x.11
      - 10.x.x.12
```
