Progress:
- Role for All in One pxe host works as expected, Role for distributed still needs to be tested a with provisioning to ensure it works as expected.
- vmprovision role works but needs some more attention around disk drive configuration and per os changes to account for issues with customization (ansible regression for windows custimization removing - characters from host names)
To Do:
- work on pxe role and get test machine pxe booting
- perform windows template deployment in vm provision
- update vm provision to support pxe provision
- rename this section to just "Provisioning" doing this because regardless of method present want this to be inclusive of how you spin up resources.
- create examples directory for example inventory and playbook.
- support more operating systems.
- Define some standards for ansible varialbes, inventory, playbooks and general syntax. indentation and naming standards primarily so code is consistent.
What to work on next:
- pxe install to a vm using the playbook, validate os installs unattended, can reach os over network at the end of the process
- write clean up component of playbook to make network boot default to local boot after playbook run
- write post os requirements like os rename for templates or post install validation steps
